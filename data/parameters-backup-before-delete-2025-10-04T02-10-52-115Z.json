    "description": "1. General Principles\n- In employment contracts, the parties cannot freely choose any legal jurisdiction to govern their contract if doing so would violate mandatory laws designed to protect employees.\n- Many countries impose rules that the employment relationship is governed by the law of the country where the employee habitually carries out their work or where the employment connection is strongest. This is to ensure minimum employee protections under local labor laws.\n- Parties cannot choose a governing law to circumvent mandatory labor protections of the country or state where the employee actually works, regardless of contract stipulation.\n- In cross-border contexts, international/private law or local statutes dictate that the chosen law cannot deprive employees of core protections afforded by the law of their actual work location.\n- Even if an employment agreement includes a choice of law clause selecting a foreign jurisdiction, courts may refuse to apply that choice if it undermines mandatory statutory protections or public policy of the employee's working location.\n\n2. On-Site Employment\nScenario 1: Both Parties in the Same Country/State\nThe governing law is the country or state in which both the employer and employee are based and where the work is performed.\nExample: If both are based in California and the work is performed there, set employment_governing_law_jurisdiction = \"California, USA\".\n\nScenario 2: Employer and Employee in Different Countries/States, Work Performed at Employer’s Location\nThe governing law is the country or state where the work is physically performed.\nExample: If a French employer hires a German national who relocates to work in Paris, set employment_governing_law_jurisdiction = \"France\".\n\n3. Remote Employment\nScenario 3: Employee Working Remotely in a Different Country/State than the Employer\nThe governing law is the country or state where the employee habitually works (remote location).\nThe parties may agree on another law, but local mandatory labor laws of the employee’s work location will override unfavorable contract terms.\nExample: UK employer hires a remote employee based in Spain. Set employment_governing_law_jurisdiction = \"Spain\".\n\n4. Hybrid Employment\nScenario 4: Split Work Between Employer’s Office (Country A) and Home/Remote (Country B)\nAssess where the employee \"habitually\" works the majority of the time. \nIf truly split or ambiguous seek legal advice. However the mandatory rules of both jurisdictions may apply.\nExample: US employer, employee works three days/week on-site in London and two days/week from home in Paris. If most time is in London, set employment_governing_law_jurisdiction = \"UK\", but clarify applicability of French labor law for remote work days.\n\nCross-border Teams: Apply local law for each employee based on their habitual work location, even if managing under one global set of policies.",
    "type": "long-text",
    "metadata": {
      "llm_instructions": "If jurisdiction known by HR: Incorporate governing law clause specifying jurisdiction name.\nExample: “Ontario, Canada”\nActivate jurisdiction-specific legal notes and advisory for contract clauses.\nEnd selection process here.\n\nMandatory Legal Considerations:\nAdvise client that the governing law chosen must not violate mandatory statutory employee protections in the employee’s work location.\n\nWhere the chosen law conflicts with mandatory protections of the employee's location, local mandatory laws generally prevail notwithstanding contract terms.\n\nIf jurisdiction unknown by HR: proceed to Step 3\n\nStep 3\nUse employment_place_work value to determine governing law:\n\nA. On-Site Work: Governing law is the law of the country/state where the employee physically works.\nExample: Employee working in Germany → governing law = “Germany”.\n\nB. Remote Work: Governing law is the law of the country/state where the employee performs remote work.\nExample: Employee working remotely from Spain → governing law = “Spain”.\n\nC. Hybrid Work: Request indication of majority work location (on-site or remote).\nIf majority on-site, governing law = laws of physical workplace jurisdiction.\nIf majority remote, governing law = laws of remote work jurisdiction.\nExample: Employee works 60% on-site in UK, 40% remote in France → governing law = “UK”.\n\nPost-Selection Activation: Once governing law is determined, activate jurisdiction-specific guidance and compliance notes throughout the contract review process to assist client in adapting clauses to local legal requirements.",

Commissions are payable within a specified period following the end of the relevant calculation time unit (such as a month or quarter) when the revenue is recognized. This method offers simplicity and straightforward calculation for sales compensation.\n\nTiered Sales Commission\nThe Employee’s commission is calculated using a tiered structure based on sales thresholds. Commissions rates vary depending on the range of sales achieved:\n\nSales up to the first threshold earn a base commission rate.\n\nSales exceeding the first threshold but within the second threshold earn a higher or different rate on that specific portion.\n\nSales beyond the second threshold earn the highest commission rate for the excess amount.\nThis tiered approach incentivizes higher sales levels with increasing commission rates as sales volume grows.

The Employee’s leave duration is extended accordingly or an additional day off is granted.\n- This treatment ensures the Employee is not “charged” annual leave for a public holiday occurring during their leave.\n\nValue: 'included'\n- The Employee’s stated annual holiday entitlement (e.g., 25 days) includes the usual public holidays observed in the jurisdiction specified by employment_public_holiday_region.\n- Public holidays count within the annual leave days; therefore, if the Employee takes leave over public holidays, those public holidays are counted against their total leave entitlement.\n- Example: An Employee with 25 days’ annual leave including public holidays effectively has fewer days of discretionary leave than if public holidays were excluded.\n- If the Employee is required to work on a public holiday, the Employer may compensate the Employee either by granting a day off in lieu or by providing additional pay, subject to applicable laws and company policies.\n- This approach bundles statutory holidays within the overall leave entitlement for simplicity and consistency with certain local employment practices.",

Employers typically define this clearly in their policies to avoid ambiguity.\n\nWhen Public Holidays Are Excluded:\n\nThe employee receives the specified number of paid annual leave days in addition to the usual public holidays observed in the relevant region.\n\nPublic holidays are not deducted from or counted within this annual leave allowance; rather, they are granted separately as paid days off.\n\nThis approach increases the total number of paid leave days during the year since public holidays are additional to the base annual leave days.\nExample: If the parameter is set to 20 days and the region observes 8 public holidays, the employee effectively has 28 paid days off during the year.\n\nWhen Public Holidays Are Included:\n\nThe employee’s total paid leave entitlement, as specified by the parameter, includes the usual public holidays observed in the relevant region, meaning public holidays count toward the annual leave total.\n\nIf the employee is required to work on a public holiday, the Employer may provide a substitute day off (“day off in lieu”) or additional payment, in compliance with applicable laws or contractual terms.\n\nUnder this approach, annual leave days and public holidays combine to form a single entitlement pool, resulting in fewer discretionary annual leave days separate from public holidays.",

It establishes a service threshold that acts as the starting point for calculating extra annual leave entitlement awarded for long service.\n\nEmployees do not receive additional annual leave days for any years of service up to and including this threshold. Additional leave days accrue only for full years of service beyond this number.\n\nThis threshold provides a clear qualification period after which seniority benefits apply, helping the Employer manage leave benefits cost-effectively while appropriately rewarding employee loyalty.\n\nContextual Use: This threshold works alongside other parameters such as the number of additional annual leave days granted per year beyond the threshold and the maximum cap on additional leave days. It forms part of a progressive annual leave benefit designed to encourage retention and recognize long-term service.\n\nExample: If the seniority threshold is set at 3 years, an Employee who has completed 5 full years of service is entitled to additional annual leave days for 2 years only (years 4 and 5), not for the first 3 years. An Employee with less than or exactly 3 years of service is not entitled to any additional seniority-based leave unless the Employer agrees otherwise in writing.\n\nSpecial Note on Partial Year Service: Partial years within a holiday year at the start of employment are typically excluded from the seniority calculation unless explicitly agreed otherwise to ensure additional leave is granted solely for fully completed years beyond the threshold.",

This “use it or lose it” approach encourages timely leave utilization and helps Employers manage liabilities from unused leave.\n\n‘carryover-limited’: Employees may carry forward unused annual leave up to a specified maximum ({{ employment_holiday_max_carryover }} days).

To encourage periodic leave-taking and manage leave liability, Employers often impose a restriction on the amount of unused leave that can be carried over to the following year.\n\nThe maximum carryover limit may be expressed as a fixed number of days (e.g., 5 or 10 days) or as zero, meaning no carryover is allowed unless subject to prior agreement.\n\nExample: If the parameter is set to 5 days, an Employee may carry forward at most 5 unused annual leave days from the current year to the next. Any additional unused days beyond 5 will be forfeited unless the Employer provides explicit written consent.\n\nDefault: A common default for this parameter is 5 days, which balances employee flexibility with the Employer’s need to control leave liabilities and operational planning.",

This policy typically encourages Employees to use their holiday entitlement during employment and avoids financial liabilities for unused leave.\n\npay-accrued: Annual leave accrues progressively throughout the employment and any untaken accrued leave is compensated as part of the Employee’s remuneration. Payment can be made during regular pay periods or as a lump sum upon termination. This ensures that Employees are financially compensated for leave earned but not yet taken.\n\npay-request: The Employer may, at its sole discretion and subject to operational requirements, compensate the Employee for accrued but untaken leave during the term of employment if the Employee submits a written request. This policy offers flexibility and control to the Employer while providing Employees the opportunity to monetize unused leave with approval.\n\npayment-termination: Upon termination of employment, the Employee is entitled to payment in lieu of any accrued but untaken leave, calculated proportionally to the length of service completed during the leave year and accounting for any excessive leave already taken.

It defines how and when either party—the Employer or the Employee—may terminate the employment agreement, including the required notice, conditions, and any scaling based on tenure.\n\nNotice Types and Effects:\n\nat-will: Available for appointment types: indefinite, fixed-term-with-notice, and initial-fixed-then-notice. This type permits either party to terminate the Agreement at any time, with or without cause, and with or without providing notice, unless otherwise restricted by applicable law or contract terms. It offers the greatest flexibility for termination. While widely accepted in the many US states, this type is generally not recognized or enforceable in most other jurisdictions with stronger employee protections where minimum notice or cause is required.\n\nfixed-notice: This requires a specified minimum notice period to be given in writing before termination. Widely required in most jurisdictions including Europe, Canada, Australia, and many parts of Asia and the Middle East. Statutory minimum notice periods exist and contracts must comply or extend these requirements. Pay in lieu of notice is often allowed when notice is not served.\n\nscaling-notice: Designed to reflect increasing tenure, this type applies to indefinite and initial-fixed-then-notice after the initial fixed term. Its common in jurisdictions with seniority-based protections (e.g., Germany, France, Canada, Australia). Notice periods increase with length of service, scaling the notice period based on continuous years of employment. Contracts must align with legally mandated increments and maximum limits.\n\nLegal Jurisdiction Considerations: The enforceability and applicability of these termination notice types depend heavily on the governing law where the employment is situated. Employers must clearly specify the governing jurisdiction in the contract and ensure the chosen value complies with mandatory local labor laws.

    "description": "This parameter specifies the predefined time period (duration) after which, if a Force Majeure Event continues without resolution, either party to the employment agreement may terminate the contract by providing written notice.\n\nFunction in the Clause: The Force Majeure clause typically suspends the obligations of both Employer and Employee while an uncontrollable event is ongoing. However, it is not indefinite. This parameter sets a clear, contractual maximum duration for how long the parties must tolerate the suspension before having an option to terminate.\n\nFormat and Units: This duration is usually expressed in a measurable time unit such as days, weeks, or months (e.g., \"60 days\", \"3 months\"). The exact unit and value are defined when configuring the employment agreement.\n\nEffect of Reaching the Duration: If the Force Majeure Event persists beyond this duration, either the Employer or the Employee can give written notice to terminate the employment contract. This protects both parties from indefinite suspension and uncertainty regarding employment status during prolonged force majeure situations.\n\nBalance Consideration: Setting a reasonable continuance period balances operational flexibility—allowing both parties time to recover or adapt—with the need for certainty and the ability to exit the relationship if the disruption is protracted.\n\nExample Usage: If its set to \"90 days,\" neither party would be liable for delays up to that period, but if the force majeure event lasts beyond 90 days, either party may terminate the agreement with written notice.",
