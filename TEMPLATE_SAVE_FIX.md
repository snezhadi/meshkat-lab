# Document Template Save Issue - Fixed

## Problem
Creating new document templates and saving template changes worked locally but failed on the VPS production environment. Parameters worked correctly in both environments.

## Root Cause
The document templates API (`app/api/admin/document-templates/route.ts`) was using **synchronous** file system operations:
- `fs.readFileSync()`
- `fs.writeFileSync()`
- `fs.existsSync()`
- `fs.unlinkSync()`
- `fs.accessSync()`

These synchronous methods are known to have issues in Docker/production environments with:
- File locking
- Permission handling
- Race conditions
- I/O blocking

Meanwhile, the parameters API was using **asynchronous** `fs.promises` methods which handle these scenarios more reliably.

## Solution
Converted all file system operations in the document templates API to use async methods:

### Changes Made:
1. **Import statement**: Changed from `import fs from 'fs'` to `import { promises as fs } from 'fs'`
2. **All functions**: Made async and added `await` keywords
3. **File existence checks**: Changed from `fs.existsSync()` to `await fs.access().then(() => true).catch(() => false)`
4. **File operations**: 
   - `fs.readFileSync()` → `await fs.readFile()`
   - `fs.writeFileSync()` → `await fs.writeFile()`
   - `fs.unlinkSync()` → `await fs.unlink()`
   - `fs.mkdirSync()` → `await fs.mkdir()`

### Methods Updated:
- `ensureDataDirectories()` - Now async
- `initializeDefaultData()` - Now async
- `GET()` - Already async, now uses async fs methods
- `POST()` - Already async, now uses async fs methods
- `DELETE()` - Already async, now uses async fs methods

## Benefits
✅ Consistent with parameters API approach  
✅ Better handling of file locks in Docker  
✅ More robust permission handling  
✅ Non-blocking I/O operations  
✅ Better error handling in production environments  

## Testing
After deploying this fix to your VPS:
1. Pull the latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Rebuild containers: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build`
3. Test creating a new template
4. Test editing and saving existing templates
5. Test checkpoint creation

Both local and production environments should now work consistently.
